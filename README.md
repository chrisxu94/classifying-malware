# classifying-malware
Multiclass classification problem with 14 malware classes

# In this repo, we tackle the problem of classifying malware into 14 classes of malware (plus the 
# important class of "not malware")

We try a whole bunch of different methods. In terms of features, we use the raw n-grams (an approach inspired by the 
literature). But the simple features of using the individual system calls in the software were actually the most effective,
and less computationally expensive. In terms of models, we tried a wide variety, from basic neural nets, to KNN, to simple 
logistic regression - but we found that random forests performed the best.

Overall, we were able to achieve 82% accuracy on the test dataset.
